The biggest reason is developer happiness from not having to manage too many files that are intrinsically linked to each other and not having to use different tools to get the *single* job done ðŸŒ¹.

But of course, there are lots of other reasons as well and we present a few below.

## Concept: Hashed className

CSS class names (e.g. `.btn`) suffer from global conflicts. 

* This makes integrating with third party libraries hard. Each library must follow a convention to prevent mistakes e.g. `bootstrap-btn` but *most libraries* don't and camp on global names.
* This makes even writing maintainable CSS *in your project* hard and you need to treat it as *global* e.g. if you want to create a class for buttons in two components e.g. date picker and a file dropzone you must have `.mine-datepicker-button` and `.mine-dropzone-button` to prevent mistaken conflicts. With JS/TS you would probably have seperate `.js` files (e.g. `datePicker.js` and `dropzone.js`) and each can have a local variable `buttonClass` without any conflicts. You don't even need to export these to the outside world.

However due to limitations of CSS we still need to generate a CSS file to allow you to use features like hover states and media queries. Hence we generate a className based on the content for you: 

```play
import {style} from 'typestyle';

const myColorClass = style({color:'red'});

<div>The generated class name: {myColorClass}</div>;
```

This gives you: 

* Isolation: No globals!

## Concept: Deduping

It is safe to call `style` with the same object strucure again and again (e.g. from within a react render function) as it doesn't generate new CSS if its not required this is shown below: 

```play
import {style} from 'typestyle';
import * as csx from 'typestyle/lib/csx';

const a = style({color:csx.red});
const b = style({color:csx.red});

<div>a:{a},b:{b}. Same? {(a===b).toString()}</div>;
```

This gives the following gains: 

* No needless CSS updates + reflows.
* True freedom to use `className` like you would use `style` in your framework of choice.
* No style bloat: Automatically smaller stylesheets based on your object reuse.

## Concept: Dead CSS 

Determining the impact of a CSS className on your codebase is one of the hardest problems facing frontend maintainability. 

Having the styles managed in JS (especially with TypeScript) gives you the following immediate gains:

* You can immediately see all the places where a class is used (e.g find references in TypeScript). This also gives you the *impact* footprint of a CSS class.
* Refactor class names easily, especially true with TypeScript (e.g. from `fooClass` to `barClass`. You no longer need to be afraid to touch your CSS class names).
* Remove CSS classes that are no longer used easily (e.g. switch on `noUnusedLocals` in TypeScript).
* Delete a TS file containing CSS classNames. If its used you get a nice compiler error which you can fix easily (same way you fix / remove unused JS code). Next go out and party ðŸŽ‰.
* Based on how *all module loaders work* (including webpack/tsify/rollup) if a file isn't *required*, it doesn't become a part of the bundle. So their CSS also goes away *automatically*. 
* With fancy tree shaking module loaders (like rollup/webpack2) if a varaible isn't used its removed from the bundle. So even without `noUnusedLocals`, the CSS bound to these variables (e.g. `const fooUnused = style({color:'red'})`) goes away.  

## More boring reasons 

Beyond that here is a boring list of additional reasons to use TypeStyle.

* No context switching your brain (think its worth mentioning again).
* Built in dependency system same as the rest of your JS. No special code for CSS needed.
* Ship CSS in the same channel that you ship JS, with no special configuration being required by your library user.
* Minification (Minify JS with existing tools). The CSS we generate is already nearly whitespace free.
* Shared constants and reusable styles (Using variables and objects)
* Extensible (Just use JavaScript with all its power)
* Your components are still free to have class names that you can give to external people to further style your stuff (better still take `clasName` as a property and let them use *typestyle* too!).
* Develop components alongside the style (No more hunting CSS files for estranged `ul > li > a`)
* Create isomorphic applications (easy export to a CSS file is supported)
* All the power of CSS without compromise e.g. pseudo states (`{ '&:hover': { ... } }`)
* Better than CSS management of media queries (`{ '@media (min-width: 500px)': { ... } }`)
* Overload CSS properties using arrays (`{ backgroundColor: ['red', 'linear-gradient(to right, red 0%, blue 100%)'] }`)
* Super small core size (~1k).
* Extremely small and powerful API that works with any ecosystem.
* Provides great TypeScript developer autocomplete experience.
* No custom AST transform or module loader support needed.
* Works with any framework (react, angular2, cyclejs, whatever, doesn't matter).
* Zero config. Just use.

> Note: Many of these are truly the advantages of using FreeStyle. The additional features by typestyle are *autoinjection*, *`css.d.ts`* (for autocomplete and errors), and *csx* (a great set of CSS functions and mixins to give a smooth learning curve for even new CSS devs).
